<a name="desc"></a>
# Description 

This application logs burger data using mySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and an ORM, following MVC design patterns. It routes data to and from the database, and uses handlebars to dispaly dynamic interfaces which allow users to add additional burgers to the menu, "devour" available burgers, and delete all burgers from the database.
